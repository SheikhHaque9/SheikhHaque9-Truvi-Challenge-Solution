# docker-compose.yml for the ETL project
# This compose file defines two services: postgres and etl.
#
# Services:
# 1. postgres:
#    - Uses the official PostgreSQL 15 image.
#    - Sets up environment variables for database, user, and password.
#    - Maps container port 5432 to host port 5432.
#    - Includes a healthcheck to ensure the database is ready before ETL starts.
#
# 2. etl:
#    - Builds the ETL project Docker image from the local Dockerfile.
#    - Depends on the postgres service being healthy before starting.
#    - Sets environment variables to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
#    - Maps container port 5000 to host port 5000 for the fake API.
#    - Mounts the host's ./output folder to /app/output inside the container,
#      ensuring any exported CSVs or output files persist on the host machine.
